Writing Assignment1:
One example of a software that I personally found very well designed is Minecraft.

When I think how complicated this game is in both ways, the coding and the design, it’s 
mind-blowing. First, let’s start with the design. The one-by-one block may sound simple, 
but it’s super creative, and you are free to do whatever you want and wherever you wish in 
this open world game, fighting the mobs with their different designs and abilities. The 
simple graphics allow players of all ages to play it with joy and fun. The adventure and the 
story made it the most sold video game in history till now, and that shows you how good 
and well-designed this game is. As for programming and coding, the game contains hard 
and complex coding using Java as a programming language; it makes it fit the game design. 
The movement and the action in the game reflect the hard work in programming and design 
at the same time its very complex to match the movement with the programing action.
Software design is so important for many reasons, like it affects how users interact with the 
program. Good designed software satisfies the user needs and makes doing the tasks 
easier. On the other hand, poorly designed software makes it hard for the user to reach 
their target; the users, in the end, will stop using it. A well-built design will try its best to 
satisfy the user and make doing the tasks clear and simple, ensuring their experience with 
the program is as good as possible. Like, look at Minecraft; they succeeded in showing us 
that simple but good design can turn a simple game into one of the most popular and well-known video games ever and made a whole generation play it, love it, and enjoy it at the 
same time.

Writing Assignment2:

The requirements gathering stage is when the developers and the clients work together to know 
exactly what they want the software to do to make sure the user have the best experience using the 
software , and another reason that make this step is really important because it helps make sure 
the software is useful and solves the right problems and to work as the clients need. By use the 
surveys and interviews to talk to the people who will use the software that will help the developers 
to understand what features are needed and what issues might come up .if this step is skipped or 
done poorly the software might end up missing important features or not working the way users 
expect , which could lead to wasting time , money and resources .

For Minecraft software here some users stories:

As a new player , I want to explore the world so that I can learn how to play and discover nice 
places.
As a player , I want to build things with different blocks so that I can create my own place as I want .

As a player , I want to fight monsters so that I can stay alive in the game and collect different items 
for monsters.

As a player , I want to switch between different game modes so that I can choose how I want to play 
like survival or creative mods.

As a player , I want to switch the difficulty in the game so that I can choose how hard I want the 
game to be.
